//also need to handle the following cases:

    (DONE) Whitespace (They should all change the character count, but otherwise be ingnored unless in a string literal.)
        Spaces, tabs and newlines are valid. 
        

    (DONE) Comments (Recognize and ignore comments)
        %      (Regex proposed in minim.jlex)
        //*    (Regex proposed in minim.jlex)

    (DONE) Identifiers ((a sequence of one or more letters and/or digits and/or underscores, starting with a letter or underscore, excluding reserved words)
        RegEx   (Regex propsed in minim.jlex)

    Integer literals
        RegEx
        (DONE) Check for bad integer literals (I think I did this in the {DIGIT} function.)

    String literals
        RegEx
        Check for unterminated string literals 
        Check for bad string literals

        Include:
            an escaped character: a backslash followed by any one of the following six characters:
                n
                t
                a single quote
                a double quote
                a question mark
                another backslash
            or
            a single character (other than newline or double quote or backslash)

    (DONE for us I think) Illegal characters
        Any character that is not whitespace and is not part of a token or comment is illegal.
